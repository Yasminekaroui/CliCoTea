# CLiCoTEA: Cross-Lingual Contextualised Token Embedding Alignment

This code reproduces the results from ACL 2023 paper ["Stop Pre-Training: Adapt Visual-Language Models to Unseen Languages "](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16774).

## Installation
These dependencies must be installed:
- [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/): for managing the Python package
- [gdown](https://pypi.org/project/gdown/): for downloading the datasets
```
pip install hatch gdown
```

## Prepare datasets

Download all datasets from Cross-Lingual Contextualised Token Embedding Alignment and Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual transfer to downstream tasks:
```bash
bash scripts/datasets/download_datasets.sh data
```
The [archive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qG3smKmz6l9BDwTxOwjcWhT4IGh4jIfB/view?usp=sharing) contains the original files from [Flickr30k](https://shannon.cs.illinois.edu/DenotationGraph/), [SNLI](https://huggingface.co/datasets/snli) and [NLVR2](https://github.com/lil-lab/nlvr/tree/master/nlvr2) which are all in English.
It also includes the translated files for each language required in the downstream tasks.

Note that the translation of train/dev sets of Flickr30k, SNLI and NVLR2 datasets has be done using [Googletrans](https://py-googletrans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package, running the following commands:
```bash
bash scripts/datasets/prepare_flickr30k.sh
bash scripts/datasets/prepare_snli.sh
bash scripts/datasets/prepare_nlvr2.sh
```

## Compute token alignment with `awesome-align` package.

```bash
bash scripts/alignment/token_alignment_flickr30k.sh
bash scripts/alignment/token_alignment_snli.sh
bash scripts/alignment/token_alignment_nlvr2.sh
```

## Train CLiCoTEA

Train CLiCoTEA (modify environment variables first):
```bash
# train CLiCoTEA for image/text retrieval on flickr30k in German
bash scripts/embeddings/train_clicotea.sh flickr30k albef_retrieval flickr de

# train CLiCoTEA for visual reasoning on NLVR2 in Swahili
bash scripts/embeddings/train_clicotea.sh nlvr2 albef_nlvr nlvr sw

# train CLiCoTEA for visual entailment on SNLI in French
1bash scripts/embeddings/train_clicotea.sh snli albef_classification ve fr
```
Note that we start from pre-trained ALBEF models which are available in [LAVIS](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS) package.

## Zero-shot transfer to unseen languages

1. Download the images of the downstream tasks from the official website:
- [Flickr30K](https://www.kaggle.com/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset)
- [MS COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#download)
- [MaRVL](https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP3/42VZ4P)

Text data can be downloaded from the [IGLUE](https://github.com/e-bug/iglue) Benchmark with:
```bash
bash scripts/zero-shot/download_datasets.sh
```

2. Run zero-shot evaluation:
```bash
DATA_DIR=<path to folder containing test files>
LANG=<language to test>
FLICKR30K_IMAGE_ROOT=<place path to image folder>
COCO_IMAGE_ROOT=<place path to image folder>
MARVL_IMAGE_ROOT=<place path to image folder>
PATH_TO_CHECKPOINT=<place path to model checkpoint>
```
- Retrieval task on xFlickrCO

```bash
bash scripts/zero-shot/zeroshot_retrieval.sh $DATA_DIR $LANG $FLICKR30K_IMAGE_ROOT $COCO_IMAGE_ROOT $PATH_TO_CHECKPOINT
```

- Visual entailment task on XVNLI

```bash
bash scripts/zero-shot/zeroshot_ve.sh $DATA_DIR $LANG $FLICKR30K_IMAGE_ROOT $PATH_TO_CHECKPOINT
```

- Visual reasoning task on MaRVL

```bash
bash scripts/zero-shot/zeroshot_vr.sh $DATA_DIR $LANG $MARVL_IMAGE_ROOT $PATH_TO_CHECKPOINT
```

## Running tests

Running all tests:
```bash
hatch run test:run
```

Or running a specific test:
```bash
hatch run test:run -k test_get_token_pairs
```
